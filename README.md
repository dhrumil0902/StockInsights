# Stock Insights

As a passionate trader, I often found myself switching between different platforms to gather all the stock information I needed. To simplify this, I created an application that brings everything together in one easy-to-use dashboard. Designed for traders and investors, this app helps users track their investments and gain insights into their stocks.

## Features
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Manage and track your stock investments with ease
- **Watchlist:** Add stocks to your watchlist and monitor their performance
- **Real-time News:** Get tailored news regardign a specific ticker (using Bing API)
- **Reddit Integration:** View relevant Reddit threads discussing the stocks you're interested in. You can also see discussions based on filters ('Trending', 'Latest', 'Popular')
- **Price-Time Graphs:** Visualize historical stock price trends with interactive graphs (using Twelve Data API)
